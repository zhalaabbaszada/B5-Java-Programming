/*
    static
        - all objects share/have same copy/version
        - if it changes/updated all objects are affected
        - we use Class Name to reach the static members
            - You can reach static members by object reference as well but NOT good practice.
        - Static ONLY works/accepts static members


     instance
        - every object has its own copy/version
        - if instance for one object is changed/updated, it ONLY affects that object
        - We use object reference to reach instance members
            - Ca not reach instance member by Class name.
        - Instance can work/accept BOTH static and instance members
